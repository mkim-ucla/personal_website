\### Air Pollution and Respiratory Health: An Observational Study on California Population

\### Overview

This project focused on exploring the relationship between air pollution, air quality index, and the number of respiratory patients across various hospitals in California.

Hospital data was sourced from the California Health and Human Services Hospital Emergency department, which contained summary counts of patients based on demographics and principal diagnoses from the years 2010 to 2023. Annual summary measures of air quality and airborne toxins were sourced from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The data was then compiled to explore the intersection between patient demographics, diagnoses and air pollution.

The project addresses a growing disparity in healthcare access across California, mainly of racial and income disparities. The county-wide analysis of air quality and demographics reveals a deeper connection between rapid urbanization, marginalized communities and the hardships they face in being disproportionately affected by air pollution.
