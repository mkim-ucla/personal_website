The primary focus of the project was to see whether the time it takes to bet could uncover the deception of a bluff.\nData was collected from hand histories of private, real-money cash games hosted on PokerNow.club platform. We then processed and cleaned these logs, filtering out any irrelevant records and extracting variables such as player action, timing information, and community cards.\nFrom this dataset, we were able to create a fairly accurate Long Short Term Memory model that predicted bluffs and values 82% of the time. We were also able to uncover inherent relationships between bluffing and community cards, player type, and their actions."

Annual summary measures of air quality and airborne toxins were sourced from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The data was then compiled to explore the intersection between patient demographics, diagnoses and air pollution.\nThe project addresses a growing disparity in healthcare access across California, mainly of racial and income disparities. The county-wide analysis of air quality and demographics reveals a deeper connection between rapid urbanization, marginalized communities and the hardships they face in being disproportionately affected by air pollution."
